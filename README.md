# Udacity-final-project---Pixel-Art-Maker
My final project from the Udacity Scholarship course on Front-end Developer.
The Project is to test my Ablities on the course i have learnt so far on Html, Css, and Javascript.
The Pixel Art Maker is developed to have the following functions:
to develop an interface that allowed the user to create a table grid canvas and to paint each individual cell within that table using colors they choose with the color input type.
The project is created using Html, Css and Javascript.
